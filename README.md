## Coverage Compare

This action will get a coverage summary from S3 to compare the BASE branch coverage (typically master) with the coverage in the branch a pull request is opened against.

This action assumes that AWS credentials will have already been configured (for example, using https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
